INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup (100 g) unsalted butter
1 cup (200 g) soft brown sugar
125 g (4 and 1/2 oz) chocolate (dark/bittersweet), chopped
1 tbsp maple syrup or golden syrup
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 cup (100 g) all-purpose flour
fresh fruit, icing sugar or whipped cream to serve

LET'S GET COOKING...
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F and grease an 8 inch (20 cm) cake tin with butter and then dust with flour.
2. To a medium sized saucepan over medium heat, add the butter, sugar, chocolate and maple syrup and melt until smooth, then take off the heat and cool slightly. This step can also be done in the microwave.
3. Whisk in the eggs and vanilla, followed by the baking soda, salt, cocoa powder and flour.
4. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 20-25 min. This cake can be served cold out of the fridge or warm, with fresh fruit, icing sugar and whipped cream or creme fraiche.
